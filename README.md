[Promtail][promtail] is an agent which ships the contents of local logs to a private
[Loki][loki] instance or [Grafana Cloud][grafana-cloud]. It is usually deployed
to every machine that has applications needed to be monitored.

## About

By default this addon version of Promtail will tail logs from the systemd
journal. This will include all logs from all addons, supervisor, home assistant,
docker, and the host system itself. In addition you can set it up to look for
local log files in `/share` or `/ssl` if you have a particular add-on that logs
to a file instead of to `stdout`.
